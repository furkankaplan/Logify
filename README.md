# Why I need to use Logify?

As discussed before in a lot of developer forums, Xcode doesn't support console coloring since Xcode 8. Because Apple has removed plug-ins from Xcode - I think the reason is security for developers - and has introduced Xcode extensions. And Xcode extensions are not providing any solution to colorize the terminal. In a short, there is no built-in support to achieve this.

# Well, what type of solutions we have?

Thanks god that Xcode supports unicode. So you can add related emojis as a prefix to your logs. But it's a limited solution, definitely.

# How Logify works and colorize logs of my Xcode project?

It's not a magic that Logify reads the system logs related with your app from the Console app. It filters the result with the parameters of both `subsystem` and `category` set in your valuable Xcode project, sure in the logger manager.

# How to use LogifyÂ cli?
After set up the application, open terminal app. Run that command.

 ```curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/furkankaplan/Logify/main/Logify --output Logify```

After the download finished, run that command.

 ```chmod +x Logify ```
 
As a last step, move the file to /usr/local/bin

 ```mv Logify /usr/local/bin ```

# How to trace logs?

Executue the command below to trace instant logs.

```logify your_subsystem:your_category```
